# Installation

Depending on your use case, you might need the C++ library for integration into your GPU application, or the Python library for analysis and visualization.

## C++ Library (Integration)

The recommended way to integrate `gpufl` into your C++ project is via CMake's `FetchContent`.

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.20 or higher
- CUDA Toolkit (including CUPTI)
- A C++17 compatible compiler

### CMake Integration

Add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
    gpufl
    GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/gpu-flight/gpufl-client.git
    GIT_TAG        main
)

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(gpufl)
```

Then link your target:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(my_app PRIVATE gpufl CUDA::cudart CUDA::cupti)
```

## Python Library (Analysis)

The Python library provides tools for analyzing and visualizing the logs generated by the C++ library.

### Basic Installation

```bash
pip install gpufl
```

### Full Installation (with Visualization)

To include all dependencies for analysis and visualization (like `matplotlib` and `numba`):

```bash
pip install "gpufl[numba,viz,analyzer]"
```
